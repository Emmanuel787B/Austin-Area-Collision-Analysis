# Austin-Area-Collision-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to anaylze Austin traffic reports involving collisions with automobiles. With real time data from the last 4 years, 
I set out to find which season do most collisions occur, and also to find which times of the day/night do most collisions happen. 
The collisions analyzed are from accidents that contain at least some minor injury, all the way to fatal accidents.
